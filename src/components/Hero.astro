    <p>Iâ€™m a <span>product designer</span>. A multi-skilled <span>Front-end dev</span>, I see no boundary between form and function. My work combines an understanding across visual design, user experience, branding and even prototyping & motion. I have collaborated with agencies around the world. Originally from Paris, I studied at Hetic and made my first experiential website at Werkstatt Studio. Next, I joined Mediamonks in Amsterdam as a visual designer. And lately, I created digital products at Work&Co based in NY.</p>
